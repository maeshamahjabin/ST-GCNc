I verify that I am the sole author of the programs contained in this folder, except where explicitly stated to the contrary.

In this case, the framework is borrowed from https://github.com/yysijie/st-gcn, 
except for modifications made in net/utils/graph.py, net/st_gcn.py and processor/recognition.py.
